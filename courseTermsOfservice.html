          <h6>Last Revised: 10-03-2020
            PLEASE READ THIS TERMS & CONDITIONS ONLINE EDUCATION AGREEMENT CAREFULLY, AS IT CONTAINS IMPORTANT
            INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.
          </h6>.
          <center>
            <h6><b>TERMS & CONDITIONS (Online Education)</b></h6>
          </center>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Xenontech Technologies’s mission is to improve lives through learning. We
            enable
            anyone anywhere to create and share educational courses (instructors) and to enroll in these educational
            courses to learn (students). We consider our marketplace model the best way to offer valuable educational
            content to our users. We need rules to keep our platform and services safe for you, us and our student and
            instructor community. These Terms apply to all your activities on the Xenontech Technologies website, the
            Xenontech
            Technologies mobile applications, our TV applications, our APIs and other related services (“Services”).
            If you publish a course on the Xenontech Technologies platform, you must also agree to the Terms. We also
            provide
            details regarding our processing of personal data of our students and instructors in our Privacy Policy. If
            you are using Xenontech Technologies as part of your employer’s Xenontech Technologies For Business learning
            and
            development program (UFB), you can consult our Xenontech Privacy Statement.
          </p><br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">If you live in the India, United States or Canada, by agreeing to these Terms,
            you agree to resolve disputes with Xenontech Technologies through binding arbitration (with very limited
            exceptions, not in court), and you waive certain rights to participate in class actions, as detailed in the
            Dispute Resolution section.
          </p><br>
          <center>
            <h6><b>1. Accounts </b></h6>
          </center>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">You need an account for most activities on our platform. Keep your password
            somewhere safe, because you’re responsible for all activity associated with your account. If you suspect
            someone else is using your account, let us know by contacting our Support Team. You must have reached the
            age of consent for online services in your country to use Xenontech.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">You need an account for most activities on our platform, including to purchase
            and enroll in a course or to submit a course for publication. When setting up and maintaining your account,
            you must provide and continue to provide accurate and complete information, including a valid email address.
            You have complete responsibility for your account and everything that happens on your account, including for
            any harm or damage (to us or anyone else) caused by someone using your account without your permission. This
            means you need to be careful with your password. You may not transfer your account to someone else or use
            someone else’s account without their permission. If you contact us to request access to an account, we will
            not grant you such access unless you can provide us the login credential information for that account. In
            the event of the death of a user, the account of that user will be closed.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">If you share your account login credential with someone else, you are
            responsible for what happens with your account and Xenontech Technologies will not intervene in disputes
            between
            students or instructors who have shared account login credentials. You must notify us immediately upon
            learning that someone else may be using your account without your permission (or if you suspect any other
            breach of security) by contacting our Support Team. We may request some information from you to confirm that
            you are indeed the owner of your account. </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Students and instructors must be at least 18 years of age to create an account
            on Xenontech Technologies and use the Services. If you are younger than the required age, you may not set up
            an
            account, but we encourage you to invite a parent or guardian to open an account and help you enroll in
            courses that are appropriate for you. If we discover that you have created an account and you are younger
            than the required age for consent to use online services (for example, 13 in the US), we will terminate your
            account. you may be requested to verify your identity before you are authorized to submit a course for
            publication on Xenontech.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">You can terminate your account at any time. Read our policy to see what
            happens when you terminate your account.
          </p></br>
          <center>
            <h6><b>2. Course Enrollment and Lifetime Access</b></h6>
          </center>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">When you enroll in a course, you get a license from us to view it via the
            Xenontech
            Technologies Services and no other use. Don’t try to transfer or resell courses in any way. We grant you a
            lifetime access license, except when we must disable the course because of legal or policy reasons. </p>
          </br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Under our Terms, when instructors publish a course on Xenontech, they grant
            Xenontech
            Technologies a license to offer a license to the course to students. This means that we have the right to
            sublicense the course to the students who enroll in the course. As a student, when you enroll in a course,
            whether it’s a free or paid course, you are getting from Xenontech Technologies a license to view the course
            via
            the Xenontech Technologies platform and Services, and Xenontech Technologies is the licensor of record.
            Courses are
            licensed, and not sold, to you. This license does not give you any right to resell the course in any manner
            (including by sharing account information with a purchaser or illegally downloading the course and sharing
            it on torrent sites).
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">In legal, more complete terms, Xenontech Technologies grants you (as a
            student) a
            limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and view the courses and associated content for
            which you have paid all required fees, solely for your personal, non- commercial, educational purposes
            through the Services, in accordance with these Terms and any conditions or restrictions associated with a
            particular courses or feature of our Services. All other uses are expressly prohibited. You may not
            reproduce, redistrXenontechte, transmit, assign, sell, broadcast, rent, share, lend, modify, adapt, edit,
            create
            derivative works of, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or use any course unless we give you explicit
            permission to do so in a written agreement signed by a Xenontech Technologies authorized representative.
            This also
            applies to content you can access via any of our APIs.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">We generally give a lifetime access license to our students when they enroll
            in a course. However, we reserve the right to revoke any license to access and use courses at any point in
            time in the event where we decide or are obligated to disable access to a course due to legal or policy
            reasons, for example, if the course you enrolled in is the object of a copyright complaint, or if we
            determine its content violates our Trust & Safety Guidelines. The lifetime access is not applicable to
            add-on features and services associated with a course, for example translation captions of courses may be
            disabled by instructors at any time, and an instructor may decide at any time to no longer provide teaching
            assistance or Q&A services in association with a course. To be clear, the lifetime access is to the course
            content but not to the instructor.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Instructors may not grant licenses to their courses to student directly and
            any such direct license shall be null and void and a violation of these Terms.
          </p></br>

          <center>
            <h6><b>3. Payments, Credits, and Refunds </b></h6>
          </center>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">When you make a payment, you agree to use a valid payment method. If you
            aren’t happy with your course, Xenontech Technologies offers a 30-day refund or credit for most course
            purchases.
          </p></br>
          <p><b>3.1 Pricing </b></p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The prices of courses on Xenontech Technologies are determined based on the
            terms of
            the Terms and our Pricing and Promotions Policy. In some instances, the price of a course offered on the
            Xenontech
            Technologies website may not be exactly the same as the price offered on our mobile or TV applications, due
            to mobile platform providers’ pricing systems and their policies around implementing sales and promotions.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">We regularly run promotions and sales for our courses and certain courses are
            only available at discounted prices for a set period of time. The price applicable to a course will be the
            price at the time you complete your purchase of the course (at checkout). Any price offered for a particular
            course may also be different when you are logged into your account from the price available to users who
            aren’t registered or logged in, because some of our promotions are available to new users only.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">If you are logged into your account, the listed currency you see is based on
            your location when you created your account. If you are not logged into your account, the price currency is
            based on the country where you are located. We do not enable users to see pricing in other currencies.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">If you are a student located in a country where use and sales tax, goods and
            services tax, or value added tax is applicable to consumer sales, we are responsible for collecting and
            remitting that tax to the proper tax authorities. In certain countries, the price you see may include such
            taxes. </p></br>
          <p><b>3.2 Payments </b></p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">You agree to pay the fees for courses that you purchase, and you authorize us
            to charge your debit or credit card or process other means of payment (such as Boleto, SEPA, direct debit,
            or mobile wallet) for those fees. Xenontech Technologies works with third party payment processing partners
            to
            offer you the most convenient payment methods in your country and to keep your payment information secure.
            Check out our Privacy Policy for more details.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">When you make a purchase, you agree not to use an invalid or unauthorized
            payment method. If your payment method fails and you still get access to the course you are enrolling in,
            you agree to pay us the corresponding fees within thirty (30) days of notification from us. We reserve the
            right to disable access to any course for which we have not received adequate payments. </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">In some cases, we may issue credits to your account. These credits will be
            automatically applied towards your next course purchase on our website, but can’t be used for purchases in
            our mobile or TV applications. Credits may expire if not used within the specified period, and have no cash
            value. </p></br>
          <p><b>3.3 Refunds and Credits </b></p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">If the course you purchased is not what you were expecting, you can request,
            within 30 days of your purchase of the course, that Xenontech Technologies credit/refund your account. We
            reserve
            the right to apply a credit or a refund, at our discretion, depending on capabilities of our payment
            processing partners or the platform from which you purchased your course (website, mobile or TV app). No
            credit or refund is due to you if you request it after the 30-day guarantee time limit has passed.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">To request a credit/refund, you can mail us or request from your account with
            your contact details As detailed in the Terms, instructors agree that students have the right to receive
            these credits or refunds.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">At our discretion, if we believe you are abusing our credit/refund policy, we
            reserve the right to ban your account and to restrict all future use of the Services. If we ban your account
            or disable your access to a course due to your violation of these Terms or our guidelines, you will not be
            eligible to receive any credit or refund.
          </p></br>
          <center>
            <h6><b>4. Content and Behavior Rules </b></h6>
          </center>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">You can only use Xenontech Technologies for lawful purposes. You’re
            responsible for
            all the content that you post on our platform. You should keep the reviews, questions, posts, courses and
            other content you upload in line with our guidelines and the law, and respect the intellectual property
            rights of others. We can ban your account for repeated or major offenses. If you think someone is infringing
            your copyright on our platform, let us know.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">You may not access or use the Services or create an account for unlawful
            purposes. Your use of the Services and behavior on our platform must comply with applicable local or
            national laws or regulations of your country. You are solely responsible for the knowledge of and compliance
            with such laws and regulations that are applicable to you. You may not access our Services if you are from a
            territory where U.S. businesses are prohibited from engaging in business (such as Cuba, Iran, North Korea,
            Sudan, or Syria) or if you have been designated a Specially Designated National, Denied Person, or Denied
            Entity by the U.S. government.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">If you are a student, the Services enable you to ask questions to the
            instructors of courses you are enrolled in, and to post reviews of courses. For certain courses, the
            instructor invites you to submit content as “homework” or tests. Don’t post or submit anything that is not
            yours. </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">If you are an instructor, you can submit courses for publication on the
            platform and you can also communicate with the students who have enrolled in your courses. In both cases,
            you must abide by the law and respect the rights of others: you cannot post any course, question, answer,
            review or other content that violates applicable local or national laws or regulations of your country. You
            are solely responsible for any courses, content, and actions you post or take via the platform and Services
            and their consequences. Make sure you understand all the copyright restrictions set forth in the Terms
            before you submit any course for publication on Xenontech .
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">If we are put on notice that your course or content violates the law or the
            rights of others (for example, if it is established that it violates intellectual property or image rights
            of others, or is about an illegal activity), if we discover that your content or behavior violates our
            guidelines, or if we believe your content or behavior is unlawful, inappropriate, or objectionable (for
            example if you impersonate someone else), we may remove your content from our platform. Xenontech
            Technologies

          <p style="text-align: justify;">Xenontech Technologies has discretion in enforcing these Terms and our
            guidelines.
            We may terminate or suspend your permission to use our platform and Services or ban your account at any
            time, with or without notice, for any violation of these Terms, if you fail to pay any fees when due, upon
            the request of law enforcement or government agencies, for extended periods of inactivity, for unexpected
            technical issues or problems, or if we suspect that you engage in fraudulent or illegal activities. Upon any
            such termination we may delete your account and content, and we may prevent you from further access to the
            platforms and use of our Services. Your content may still be available on the platforms even if your account
            is terminated or suspended. You agree that we will have no liability to you or any third party for
            termination of your account, removal of your content, or blocking of your access to our platforms and
            services. </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">If one of our instructors has published a course that infringes your copyright
            or trademark rights, please let us know. Under our Terms, we require our instructors to follow the law and
            respect the intellectual property rights of others. For more details on how to file a copyright or trademark

            <h6><b>5. Xenontech Technologies’s Rights to Content You Post</b></h6>
          </center>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">You retain ownership of content you post to our platform, including your
            courses. We’re allowed to share your content to anyone through any media, including promoting it via
            advertising on other websites.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The content you post as a student or instructor (including courses) remains
            yours. By posting courses and other content, you allow Xenontech Technologies to reuse and share it but you
            do not
            lose any ownership rights you may have over your content. If you are an instructor, be sure to understand
            the course licensing terms that are detailed in the Terms.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">When you post comments, questions, reviews, and when you submit to us ideas
            and suggestions for new features or improvements, you authorize Xenontech Technologies to use and share this
            content with anyone, distrXenontechte it and promote it on any platform and in any media, and to make
            modifications or edits to it as we see fit. In legal language, by submitting or posting content on or
            through the platforms, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to
            sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display, and
            distrXenontechte your
            content in any and all media or distrXenontechtion methods (existing now or later developed). This includes
            making
            your content available to other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Xenontech
            Technologies
            for the syndication, broadcast, distrXenontechtion, or publication of content on other media. You represent
            and
            warrant that you have all the rights, power, and authority necessary to authorize us to use any content that
            you submit. You also agree to all such uses of your content with no compensation paid to you.</p></br>

            <h6><b>6. Using Xenontech Technologies at Your Own Risk </b></h6>
          </center>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Anyone can use Xenontech Technologies to create and publish courses and
            instructors
            and we enable instructors and students to interact for teaching and learning. Like other platforms where
            people can post content and interact, some things can go wrong, and you use Xenontech Technologies at your
            own
            risk. </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Xenontech Technologies enables anyone anywhere to create and share educational
            courses. We host more than 100,000 courses on our online learning marketplace. Our platform model means we
            do not review or edit the courses for legal issues, and we are not in a position to determine the legality
            of course content. We do not exercise any editorial control over the courses that are available on the
            platform and, as such, do not guarantee in any manner the reliability, validity, accuracy or truthfulness of
            the courses. If you enroll a course, you rely on any information provided by an instructor at your own risk.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">By using the Services, you may be exposed to content that you consider
            offensive, indecent, or objectionable. Xenontech Technologies has no responsibility to keep such content
            from you
            and no liability for your access or enrollment in any course, to the extent permissible under applicable
            law. This also applies to any courses relating to health, wellness and physical exercise. You acknowledge
            the inherent risks and dangers in the strenuous nature of these types of courses, and by enrolling in such
            courses, you choose to assume those risks voluntarily, including risk of illness, bodily injury, disability,
            or death. You assume full responsibility for the choices you make before, during and after your enrollment
            in a course.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">When you interact directly with a student or an instructor, you must be
            careful about the types of personal information that you share. We do not control what students and
            instructors do with the information they obtain from other users on the platform. You should not share your
            email or other personal information about you for your safety.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">We do not hire or employ instructors nor are we responsible or liable for any
            interactions involved between instructors and students. We are not liable for disputes, claims, losses,
            injuries, or damage of any kind that might arise out of or relate to the conduct of instructors or students.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">When you use our Services, you will find links to other websites that we don’t
            own or control. We are not responsible for the content or any other aspect of these third-party sites,
            including their collection of information about you. You should also read their terms and conditions and
            privacy policies.

            Our platforms and services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States

          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">You may not do any of the following while accessing or using the Xenontech
            Technologies platform and Services:
            access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the platform, Xenontech Technologies’s computer systems, or

            technical delivery systems of Xenontech Technologies’s service providers.
            disable, interfere with, or try to circumvent any of the features of the platforms related to security or

            than through our currently available search functionalities that are provided via our website, mobile apps,
            or API (and only pursuant to those API terms and conditions). You may not scrape, spider, use a robot, or
            use other automated means of any kind to access the Services.
            in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive, or false source-identifying information (such as
            sending email communications falsely appearing as Xenontech ); or interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to
            do
            so), the access of any user, host, or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, overloading,
            flooding, spamming, or mail-bombing the platforms or services, or in any other manner interfering with or
            creating an undue burden on the Services. <br>
            <b>8. Miscellaneous Legal Terms </b>
            These Terms are like any other contract, and they have boring but important legal terms that protect us from
            the countless things that could happen and that clarify the legal relationship between us and you. <br>
            <b>8.1 Binding Agreement</b><br>
            You agree that by registering, accessing or using our Services, you are agreeing to enter into a legally
            binding contract with Xenontech. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not register, access, or otherwise
            use any
            of our Services.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">If you are an instructor accepting these Terms and using our Services on
            behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are
            authorized to do so. </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Any version of these Term in a language other than English is provided for
            convenience and you understand and agree that the English language will control if there is any conflict.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">These Terms (including any agreements and policies linked from these Terms)
            constitute the entire agreement between you and us (which include, if you are an instructor, the Terms and
            the Pricing and Promotions Policy).
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">If any part of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable by
            applicable law, then that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most
            closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms will continue in
            effect. </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Even if we are delayed in exercising our rights or fail to exercise a right in
            one case, it doesn’t mean we waive our rights under these Terms, and we may decide to enforce them in the
            future. If we decide to waive any of our rights in a particular instance, it doesn’t mean we waive our
            rights generally or in the future. </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The following sections shall survive the expiration or termination of these
            Terms: Sections 2 (Course Enrollment and Lifetime Access), 5 (Xenontech Technologies’s Rights to Content You
            Post), 6 (Using Xenontech Technologies at Your Own Risk), 7 (Xenontech Technologies’s Rights), 8
            (Miscellaneous Legal
            Terms), and 9 (Dispute Resolution).</p></br>
          <p><b>8.2 Disclaimers </b></p><br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">It may happen that our platform is down, either for planned maintenance or
            because something goes down with the site. It may happen that one of our instructors is making misleading
            statements in their course. It may also happen that we encounter security issues. These are just examples.
            You accept that you will not have any recourse against us in any of these types of cases where things don’t
            work out right. In legal, more complete language, the Services and their content are provided on an “as is”
            and “as available” basis. We (and our affiliates, suppliers, partners, and agents) make no representations
            or warranties about the suitability, reliability, availability, timeliness, security, lack of errors, or
            accuracy of the Services or their content, and expressly disclaim any warranties or conditions (express or
            implied), including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and
            non-infringement. We (and our affiliates, suppliers, partners, and agents) make no warranty that you will
            obtain specific results from use of the Services. Your use of the Services (including any content) is
            entirely at your own risk. Some jurisdictions don’t allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so some of
            the above exclusions may not apply to you.</p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">We may decide to cease making available certain features of the Services at
            any time and for any reason. Under no circumstances will Xenontech Technologies or its affiliates,
            suppliers,
            partners or agents be held liable for any damages due to such interruptions or lack of availability of such
            features.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">We are not responsible for delay or failure of our performance of any of the
            Services caused by events beyond our reasonable control, like an act of war, hostility, or sabotage; natural
            disaster; electrical, internet, or telecommunication outage; or government restrictions.
          </p></br>
          <p><b>8.3 Limitation of Liability </b></p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">There are risks inherent into using our Services, for example, if you enroll
            in a health and wellness course like yoga, and you injure yourself. You fully accept these risks and you
            agree that you will have no recourse to seek damages against even if you suffer loss or damage from using
            our platform and Services. In legal, more complete language, to the extent permitted by law, we (and our
            group companies, suppliers, partners, and agents) will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive,
            or consequential damages (including loss of data, revenue, profits, or business opportunities, or personal
            injury or death), whether arising in contract, warranty, tort, product liability, or otherwise, and even if
            we’ve been advised of the possibility of damages in advance. Our liability (and the liability of each of our
            group companies, suppliers, partners, and agents) to you or any third parties under any circumstance is
            limited to the greater of one hundred dollars ($100) or the amount you have paid us in the twelve (12)
            months before the event giving rise to your claims. Some jurisdictions don’t allow the exclusion or
            limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so some of the above may not apply to you.
          </p></br>
          <p><b>8.4 Indemnification </b></p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">If you behave in a way that gets us in legal trouble, we may exercise legal
            recourse against you. You agree to indemnify, defend (if we so request), and hold harmless Xenontech , our
            group
            companies, and their officers, directors, suppliers, partners, and agents from an against any third-party
            claims, demands, losses, damages, or expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) arising from (a) the
            content you post or submit, (b) your use of the Services (c) your violation of these Terms, or (d) your
            violation of any rights of a third party. Your indemnification obligation will survive the termination of
            these Terms and your use of the Services.
          </p></br>
          <p><b>8.5 Governing Law and Jurisdiction </b></p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, USA without
            reference to its choice or conflicts of law principles. Where the “Dispute Resolution” section below does
            not apply, you and we consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of federal and state courts in Hawaii,
            USA or IPC (India)
          </p></br>
          <p><b>8.6 Legal Actions and Notices </b></p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">No action, regardless of form, arising out of or relating to this Agreement
            may be brought by either party more than one (1) year after the cause of action has accrued.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Any notice or other communication to be given hereunder will be in writing and
            given by registered or certified mail return receipt requested, or email (by us to the email associated with
            your account or by you to info@xenontech.com).</p></br>
          <p><b>8.7 Relationship Between Us </b></p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">You and we agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, contractor,
            or agency relationship exists between us.
          </p></br>
          <p><b>8.8 No Assignment </b></p><br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">You may not assign or transfer these Terms (or the rights and licenses granted
            under them). For example, if you registered an account as an employee of a company, your account cannot be
            transferred to another employee. We may assign these Terms (or the rights and licenses granted under them)
            to another company or person without restriction. Nothing in these Terms confers any right, benefit, or
            remedy on any third-party person or entity. You agree that your account is non-transferable and that all
            rights to your account and other rights under these Terms terminate upon your death.
          </p></br>

          <center>
            <h6><b>9. Dispute Resolution </b></h6>
          </center>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">If there’s a dispute, our Support Team is happy to help resolve the issue. If
            that doesn’t work and you live in the United States or Canada, your options are to go to small claims court
            or bring a claim in binding arbitration; you may not bring that claim in another court or participate in a
            non-individual class action claim against us.
          </p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">This Dispute Resolution section applies only if you live in the United States
            or Canada. Most disputes can be resolved, so before bringing a formal legal case, please first try
            contacting our Support Team.
          </p></br>
          <p><b>9.1 Small Claims </b></p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Either of us can bring a claim in small claims court in (a) San Francisco,
            California, (b) the county where you live, or (c) another places we both agree on, as long as it qualifies
            to be brought in that court.
          </p></br>
          <p><b>9.2 Going to Arbitration </b></p><br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">If we can’t resolve our dispute amicably, you and Xenontech Technologies agree
            to
            resolve any claims related to these Terms (or our other legal terms) through final and binding arbitration,
            regardless of the type of claim or legal theory. If one of us brings a claim in court that should be
            arbitrated and the other party refuses to arbitrate it, the other party can ask a court to force us both to
            go to arbitration (compel arbitration). Either of us can also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while
            an arbitration proceeding is ongoing. </p></br>
          <p><b>9.3 The Arbitration Process </b></p><br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Any disputes that involve a claim of less than $10,000 USD must be resolved
            exclusively through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. A party electing arbitration must initiate
            proceedings by filing an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The arbitration
            proceedings shall be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, Consumer Due Process Protocol, and
            Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of Consumer-Related Disputes. You and we agree that the following
            rules will apply to the proceedings: (a) the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, or based
            solely on written submissions (at the choice of the party seeking relief); (b) the arbitration must not
            involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses (unless we and you agree otherwise); and (c) any
            judgment on the arbitrator’s rendered award may be entered in any court with competent jurisdiction.
            Disputes that involve a claim of more than $10,000 USD must be resolved per the AAA’s rules about whether
            the arbitration hearing has to be in-person.
          </p></br>
          <p><b>9.4 No Class Actions </b></p></br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">We both agree that we can each only bring claims against the other on an
            individual basis. This means: (a) neither of us can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class
            action, consolidated action, or representative action; (b) an arbitrator can’t combine multiple people’s
            claims into a single case (or preside over any consolidated, class, or representative action); and (c) an
            arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s case can only impact that user, not other users, and can’t be
            used to decide other users’ disputes. If a court decides that this “No class actions” clause isn’t
            enforceable or valid, then this “Dispute Resolution” section will be null and void, but the rest of the
