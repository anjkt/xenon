            necessary steps to replace the Service by migrating to a new Service before the EOL date, or by entirely
            ceasing reliance on said Service before the EOL date. In either case, Xenontech Technologies will either
            offer a
            comparable Service for you to migrate to for the remainder of the term of your purchase, a prorated in-store
            credit, or a prorated refund, to be determined by Xenontech Technologies in its sole and absolute
            discretion. Xenontech
            Technologies may, with or without notice to you, migrate you to the most up-to-date version of the Service,
            if available. You agree to take full responsibility for any and all loss or damage arising from any such

            No Liability. Xenontech Technologies will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification,
            suspension, or discontinuance of any of the Services we may offer or facilitate access to.

            payment service provider, and subject to the provisions of our Privacy Policy.
            (A) GENERAL TERMS, INCLUDING AUTOMATIC RENEWAL TERMS
            Payment Due at Time of Order; Non-Refundable. You agree to pay all amounts due for Services at the time you
            order them. All amounts are non-refundable unless otherwise noted in the Refund Policy.
            Price Changes. Xenontech Technologies reserves the right to change its prices and fees at any time, and such
            changes shall be posted online at this Site and effective immediately without need for further notice to
            you. If you have purchased or obtained Services for a period of months or years, changes in prices and fees
            shall be effective when the Services in question come up for renewal as further described below.
            Payment Types. Except as prohibited in any product-specific agreement, you may pay for Services by using any
            of the following “Payment Methods”: (i) valid credit card, (ii) “Good As Gold Prepaid Services” (defined

            Method for your Account. Confirmation of that order will be sent to the email address on file for your
            Account. Your Payment Method on file must be kept valid if you have any active Services in your Account. In
            addition, you agree that the location for the processing of your payments may change for any reason,
            including the type of Payment Method chosen, the currency selected, or changes or updates made to your
            Payment Method.
            Refunds Issued. You agree that where refunds are issued to your Payment Method, Xenontech Technologies's
            issuance
            of a refund receipt is only confirmation that Xenontech Technologies has submitted your refund to the
            Payment
            Method charged at the time of the original sale, and that Xenontech Technologies has no control over when
            the
            refund will be applied towards your Payment Method’s available balance. You further acknowledge and agree
            that the payment provider and/or individual issuing bank associated with your Payment Method establish and
            regulate the time frames for posting your refund, and that such refund posting time frames may range from
            five (5) business days to a full billing cycle, or longer.
            In the event a refund is issued to your Payment Method and the payment provider, payment processor or
            individual issuing bank associated with your Payment Method imposes any limitations on refunds, including
            but not limited to, limitations as to the timing of the refund or the number of refunds allowed, then
            Xenontech
            Technologies, in its sole and absolute discretion, reserves the right to issue the refund either (i) in the
            form of an in-store credit; (ii) via issuance of a Xenontech Technologies check, which will be sent to the
            mailing
            address on file for your Account; or (iii) in some jurisdictions, as a bank transfer, when the payment
            processor cannot refund back to the Payment Method. Xenontech Technologies also has the right to offer an
            in-store
            credit for customers seeking refunds, even if there are no limitations on refunds imposed by the Payment
            Method.
            Monthly Billing Date. If you are being billed on a monthly basis, your monthly billing date will be based on
            the date of the month you purchased the Services, unless that date falls after the 28th of the month, in
            which case your billing date will be the 28th of each month.
            Auto-Renewal Terms. Other than as required by applicable law, Xenontech Technologies does not retain hard
            copies
            or electronic versions of mandate, standing order or standing instruction forms and/or any signed consents
            relating to your usage of our automatic renewal services, and we are therefore unable to provide any such
            document upon request. You may view or change your automatic renewal settings at any time by logging into
            your Xenontech Technologies account.
            IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT YOU DO NOT EXPERIENCE AN INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF SERVICES, ALL SERVICES ARE OFFERED
            ON AUTOMATIC RENEWAL. EXCEPT FOR REASONS DESCRIBED BELOW IN THIS SECTION, AUTOMATIC RENEWAL AUTOMATICALLY
            RENEWS THE APPLICABLE SERVICE UPON EXPIRATION OF THE THEN CURRENT TERM FOR A RENEWAL PERIOD EQUAL IN TIME TO
            THE MOST RECENT SERVICE PERIOD (EXCEPT FOR DOMAIN NAMES WHICH MAY RENEW FOR THE ORIGINAL SERVICE PERIOD).
            FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOUR LAST SERVICE PERIOD IS FOR ONE YEAR, YOUR RENEWAL PERIOD WILL TYPICALLY BE FOR ONE
            YEAR. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT RENEWAL WITH THE PAYMENT METHOD ON FILE FAILS, Xenontech TECHNOLOGIES MAY
            ATTEMPT TO
            RENEW THE APPLICABLE SERVICE FOR A PERIOD LESS THAN THE ORIGINAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY
            FOR THE TRANSACTION TO SUCCEED.
            UNLESS YOU DISABLE THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OPTION, Xenontech TECHNOLOGIES WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW THE
            APPLICABLE
            SERVICE WHEN IT COMES UP FOR RENEWAL AND WILL TAKE PAYMENT FROM THE PAYMENT METHOD ASSOCIATED WITH THE
            SERVICE(S) IN YOUR ACCOUNT OR YOUR DESIGNATED BACKUP PAYMENT METHOD(S) ON FILE WITH Xenontech TECHNOLOGIES.
            IN
            AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING YOUR SERVICES, Xenontech TECHNOLOGIES WILL FIRST ATTEMPT TO CHARGE THE PAYMENT METHOD
            ASSOCIATED WITH THE SERVICE(S) IN YOUR ACCOUNT. IN THE EVENT Xenontech TECHNOLOGIES CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY
            CHARGE
            THIS PAYMENT METHOD, WE WILL ATTEMPT TO CHARGE THE PAYMENT METHOD(S) DESIGNATED AS "BACKUP" IN YOUR ACCOUNT.
            RENEWALS WILL BE CHARGED AT Xenontech TECHNOLOGIES’S THEN CURRENT RATES, WHICH YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE MAY
            BE
            HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE RATES FOR THE ORIGINAL SERVICE PERIOD. IN ORDER TO SEE THE RENEWAL SETTINGS
            APPLICABLE TO YOU AND YOUR SERVICES, SIMPLY LOG INTO YOUR ACCOUNT MANAGER FROM THIS SITE AND FOLLOW THE
            STEPS FOUND HERE. IF YOU DO NOT WISH FOR ANY SERVICE TO AUTOMATICALLY RENEW, YOU MAY ELECT TO CANCEL
            RENEWAL, IN WHICH CASE, YOUR SERVICES WILL TERMINATE UPON EXPIRATION OF THE THEN CURRENT TERM, UNLESS YOU
            MANUALLY RENEW YOUR SERVICES PRIOR TO THAT DATE. IN OTHER WORDS, SHOULD YOU ELECT TO CANCEL YOUR PRODUCT AND
            FAIL TO MANUALLY RENEW YOUR SERVICES BEFORE THEY EXPIRE, YOU MAY EXPERIENCE AN INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF
            SERVICES, AND Xenontech TECHNOLOGIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY REGARDING THE SAME.
            IN ADDITION, Xenontech TECHNOLOGIES MAY PARTICIPATE IN “RECURRING BILLING PROGRAMS” OR “ACCOUNT UPDATER
            SERVICES”
            SUPPORTED BY YOUR CREDIT CARD PROVIDER (AND ULTIMATELY DEPENDENT ON YOUR BANK’S PARTICIPATION). IF WE ARE
            UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY CHARGE YOUR EXISTING PAYMENT METHOD, YOUR CREDIT CARD PROVIDER (OR YOUR BANK) MAY
            NOTIFY US OF UPDATES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND/OR EXPIRATION DATE, OR THEY MAY AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE
            YOUR NEW CREDIT CARD ON OUR BEHALF WITHOUT NOTIFICATION TO US. IN ACCORDANCE WITH RECURRING BILLING PROGRAM
            REQUIREMENTS, IN THE EVENT THAT WE ARE NOTIFIED OF AN UPDATE TO YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND/OR EXPIRATION
            DATE, Xenontech TECHNOLOGIES WILL AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE YOUR PAYMENT PROFILE ON YOUR BEHALF. Xenontech
            TECHNOLOGIES MAKES
            NO GUARANTEES THAT WE WILL REQUEST OR RECEIVE UPDATED CREDIT CARD INFORMATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE
            THAT IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO MODIFY AND MAINTAIN YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
            TO (I) CANCELLING PRODUCTS AND (II) ENSURING YOUR ASSOCIATED PAYMENT METHOD(S) ARE CURRENT AND VALID.
            FURTHER, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR FAILURE TO DO SO, MAY RESULT IN THE INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF
            SERVICES, AND Xenontech TECHNOLOGIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY REGARDING THE SAME.
            If for any reason Xenontech Technologies is unable to charge your Payment Method for the full amount owed,
            or if
            Xenontech Technologies receives notification of a chargeback, reversal, payment dispute, or is charged a
            penalty
            for any fee it previously charged to your Payment Method, you agree that Xenontech Technologies may pursue
            all
            available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment, including but not limited to, immediate cancellation,
            without notice to you, of any domain names or Services registered or renewed on your behalf. Xenontech
            Technologies also reserves the right to charge you reasonable “administrative” fees" for (i) tasks Xenontech
            Technologies may perform outside the normal scope of its Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs
            Xenontech
            Technologies may incur in providing its Services, and/or (iii) your noncompliance with this Agreement (as
            determined by Xenontech Technologies in its sole and absolute discretion). Typical administrative or
            processing
            fee scenarios include, but are not limited to (i) customer service issues that require additional personal
            time or attention; (ii) UDRP actions(s) in connection with your domain name(s) and/or disputes that require
            accounting or legal services, whether performed by Xenontech Technologies staff or by outside firms retained
            by
            Xenontech Technologies; (iii) recouping any and all costs and fees, including the cost of Services, incurred
            by
            Xenontech Technologies as the results of chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by you, your bank or
            Payment Method processor. These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the Payment Method

            processed in

            foreign transaction fee or other charge, which may be added to the final amount that appears on your bank
            statement or post as a separate amount. Please check with the issuer of your Payment Method for details. In
            addition, regardless of the selected currency, you acknowledge and agree that you may be charged Value Added
            Tax ("VAT"), Goods and Services Tax ("GST"), or other localized fees and/or taxes, based on your bank and/or
            the country indicated in your billing address section.

            event, neither Check Services Provider nor Xenontech Technologies shall be liable to you or any third party
            regarding the same. If for any reason Check Services Provider is unable to withdraw the full amount owed for

            available
            lawful remedies in order to obtain payment (plus any applicable fees). Xenontech Technologies is not
            responsible
            for the actions of Check Services Provider. You agree that if the EFT or bank draft is returned unpaid, you
            will pay a service charge in accordance with the fees permitted by law for each U.S. State. A help article
            describing the Check Services Provider and outlining the service charges referenced above can be found on

            Xenontech Technologies and its service providers, including but not limited to Check Services Provider and
            Complete Payment Recovery Services, Inc., may provide you with notices, including by email, regular mail,
            SMS, MMS, text message, postings on the services, or other reasonable means now known or hereafter
            developed. Such notices may not be received if you violate these terms of service by accessing the services
            in an unauthorized manner. Your agreement to these terms of service constitutes your agreement that you are
            deemed to have received any and all notices that would have been delivered had you accessed the services in
            an authorized manner. Failure to receive such notices for any reason shall not excuse any payment or other
            obligation to Xenontech Technologies and Check Services Provider. You further expressly authorize Xenontech
            Technologies
            and its service providers, including but not limited to Check Services Provider and Complete Payment
            Recovery Services, Inc., and their affiliates to contact you, via auto-dialer, pre-recorded messages, or any
            other method, on any of your mobile phone numbers or emails. You further acknowledge that email addresses
            you provide are not shared, accessed by others and are not employer-related email addresses.
            (E) INTERNATIONAL PAYMENT OPTIONS
            Xenontech Technologies offers a variety of alternative international payment options through a variety of
            International Payment Providers (“IPP”). In the event you select an IPP, you represent that you have already
            agreed to any and all of the IPP’s applicable customer service agreements in advance of completing your
            transaction at Xenontech Technologies. You also agree to allow the IPP to debit the full amount of your
            purchase
            from the selected account or payment method, collectively “Funding Sources”. In addition, you agree to allow
            the selected IPP to debit, if applicable, an “Exchange Rate Conversion Fee”, as well as any other fees or
            charges applicable to your agreement with the IPP (collectively, the “IPP Fees”), from your Funding Sources.
            You understand and agree that IPP Fees are subject to change at any time by the IPP without notice to you by
            Xenontech Technologies.
            It is your responsibility to keep your Funding Sources current and funded. You agree that (i) the IPP or
            Xenontech
            Technologies reserve the right to decline a transaction for any reason and (ii) neither the IPP nor
            Xenontech
            Technologies shall be liable to you or any third party regarding the same. You acknowledge that Xenontech
            Technologies will not attempt to fulfill the Services purchased by you until Xenontech Technologies receives
            confirmation of payment from the IPP through its associated payment processor. You acknowledge there may be
            a gap of several hours or days between the time you place an order and the time the IPP confirms payment
            through its associated payment processor. If Xenontech Technologies does not receive confirmation of payment
            from
            the IPP through its associated payment processor within thirty (30) days from when the order is placed, your
            order may be cancelled, at which time you will need to commence the purchase process again. In the event
            that you would like to cancel payment for a pending transaction, you may cancel the order through your
            Xenontech
            Technologies account. Payments received on previously cancelled orders will be automatically refunded to the
            original Payment Method when possible.
            If, at the time Xenontech Technologies receives confirmation of payment from the IPP (through its associated
            payment processor), either (i) the Services (including domain names) are no longer available for purchase;
            or (ii) a pending order has been cancelled in our systems; or (iii) the confirmation of payment does not
            match the dollar amount of the pending order, and as a result your purchase is either over-funded or
            under-funded, Xenontech Technologies may automatically issue a partial refund (in the case of over-funding)
            or a
            full refund (in the case of under-funding) to your Funding Source. If the IPP (or its associated payment
            processor) imposes refund limitations of any kind, Xenontech Technologies reserves the right to issue
            refunds to
            an in-store credit balance or as a bank transfer, when the payment processor cannot refund back to the
            Payment Method. If you receive a full refund, you will need to begin the purchase process again. You agree
            that the IPP reserves the right not to refund IPP Fees associated with a refunded transaction. Accordingly,
            any refunds issued by Xenontech Technologies will be net of the IPP Fees unless otherwise specified.
            Xenontech Technologies offers SEPA Direct Debit (“SEPA”) as a payment method for customers located in
            Germany. If
            you choose to use SEPA as a payment method, you are authorizing Xenontech Technologies and, our payment
            service
            provider, to send instructions to your bank to debit your account. By agreeing to these terms, you have
            mandated Xenontech Technologies to collect all of the applicable charges arising under this Agreement. The
            authorization shall also apply to any new bank account used by you for purchases from Xenontech
            Technologies. We
            will notify you of the date of direct debit collection within a reasonable time (the “pre-notification”).
            This pre-notification will be delivered to you by e-mail at least one (1) business day before payment is
            collected. You are responsible for making sure that there are sufficient funds in your account to cover any
            debit payments. You also agree to indemnify Xenontech Technologies against any losses that it may incur if
            your
            financial institution withholds payment from Xenontech Technologies for any reason.
            (F) IN-STORE CREDIT BALANCES
            In the event that your Account contains an in-store credit balance: (1) you may apply any available credit
            balance to any future purchase in your Account; and (2) you authorize Xenontech Technologies to apply any
            available credit balance to any outstanding administrative fees, chargebacks, or other fees related to your
            Account. In the event that Xenontech Technologies is unable to successfully charge either the Payment Method
            associated with a specific Service in your account or your backup Payment Methods when processing Service
            renewals, Xenontech Technologies may use any available in-store credit balance if there are enough funds to
            cover
            the entire transaction. Regardless of the amount of in-store credit available in your account, Xenontech
            Technologies is not responsible for the loss of products resulting from an inability to collect funds from
            your Payment Methods or the in-store credit. In-store credits will be applied based on the currency selected
            in the shopping cart at the time of purchase (or renewal). If you have more than one in-store credit, then
            the credits will be processed according to the age of the credit, with the oldest in-store credit being
            applied first. If additional funds are required to complete the purchase or renewal, credits held in a
            non-selected currency will be converted using Xenontech Technologies’s daily exchange rate based on the age
            of the
            credit (oldest to newest) until (i) enough funds are allocated to complete the transaction, or (ii) there is
            no available balance left in your account. You understand and agree that at the time of conversion,
            Xenontech
            Technologies may also impose an additional administrative fee.
            You can verify your available in-store credit balance at any time through your Account on the Xenontech
            Technologies website. You acknowledge that in-store credit balances are non-transferrable, may only be used
            in the Account in which they were acquired and may expire. Complimentary in-store credits will expire two
            years after issuance. In the event that Xenontech Technologies terminates your Account, you acknowledge and
            agree
            that any remaining available in-store credit balance will be forfeited.
            You also acknowledge that funds available in your in-store credit balance will be held by Xenontech
            Technologies
            and will not accrue or pay interest for your behalf. To the extent any interest may accrue, you agree that
            Xenontech Technologies is entitled to receive and keep any such amounts to cover costs associated with
            supporting
            the in-store credit balance functionality.
            (G) EXPIRED DOMAIN NAME PURCHASES
            For expired domains names purchased through your account, you agree that you are responsible for payment
            within forty-eight (48) hours of auction close for the successful bid amount plus the one (1) year renewal
            or transfer fee (from the end of the domain name’s previous registration period), plus ICANN fee, if
            applicable, or any valid payment method associated with the account, will be charged on the third day
            following the auction close. If we are unable to collect payment, you may lose the rights to purchase the
            domain name.

          <p style="text-align: justify;">No Spam. We do not tolerate the transmission of spam. We monitor all traffic
            to and from our web servers for indications of spamming and maintain a spam abuse complaint center to
            register allegations of spam abuse. Customers suspected to be using our products and services for the
            purpose of sending spam are fully investigated. If we determine there is a problem with spam, we will take
            the appropriate action to resolve the situation.

            We define spam as the sending of Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE), Unsolicited Bulk Email (UBE) or
            Unsolicited Facsimiles (Fax), which is email or facsimile sent to recipients as an advertisement or
            otherwise, without first obtaining prior confirmed consent to receive these communications. This can
            include, but is not limited to, the following:

            We will not allow our servers and services to be used for the purposes described above. In order to use our

            faxes may only be sent to recipients who have "opted-in" to receive messages. They must include a legitimate
            return address and reply-to address, the sender's physical address, and an opt-out method in the footer of
            the email or fax. Upon request by us, conclusive proof of opt-in may be required for an email address or fax
            number.

            If we determine the account, products, or services in question are being used
            in association with spam, we may re-direct, suspend, or cancel any account, web site hosting, domain
            registration, email boxes, or other applicable products or services. In such event, at our election, we may
            require you to respond by email to us stating that you will cease to send spam and/or have spam sent on your

            </h6>
          </center><br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IF YOU WISH
            TO OPT OUT OF THE PROVISIONS REQUIRING YOU TO RESOLVE DISPUTES THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.
            (A) Disputes. The terms of this Section shall apply to all Disputes between you and Xenontech Technologies,
            except
            for disputes governed by the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy referenced above and available.
            For the purposes of this Section, “Dispute” shall mean any dispute, claim, or action between you and
            Xenontech
            Technologies arising under or relating to any Xenontech Technologies Services or Products, Xenontech
            Technologies’
            websites, these Terms, or any other transaction involving you and Xenontech Technologies, whether in
            contract,
            warranty, misrepresentation, fraud, tort, intentional tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other
            legal or equitable basis, and shall be interpreted to be given the broadest meaning allowable under law. YOU
            AND Xenontech TECHNOLOGIES AGREE THAT “DISPUTE” AS DEFINED IN THESE TERMS SHALL NOT INCLUDE ANY CLAIM OR
            CAUSE OF
            ACTION BY YOU OR Xenontech TECHNOLOGIES FOR (I) TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION, (II) PATENT INFRINGEMENT,
            (III)
            COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT OR MISUSE, AND (IV) TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT OR DILUTION. Moreover, notwithstanding
            anything else in these Terms, you agree that a court, not the arbitrator, may decide if a claim falls within
            one of these four exceptions.
            (B) Binding Arbitration. You and Xenontech Technologies further agree: (i) to arbitrate all Disputes between
            the
            parties pursuant to the provisions in these Terms; (ii) these Terms memorialize a transaction in interstate
            commerce; (iii) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §1, et seq.) governs the interpretation and
            enforcement of this Section; and (iv) this Section shall survive termination of these Terms. ARBITRATION
            MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JUDGE OR JURY IN A COURT PROCEEDING AND YOUR GROUNDS FOR APPEAL ARE
            LIMITED. The arbitrator may award you the same damages as a court sitting in proper jurisdiction, as limited
            by the Limitation of Liability set forth in Section 19 of this Agreement and may award declaratory or
            injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to
            provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. In addition, in some instances, the costs of
            arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in
            arbitration than in court. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and enforceable by any court with
            jurisdiction over the parties.
            (C) Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring an individual action in the small
            claims court of your state or municipality if the action is within that court’s jurisdiction and is pending
            only in that court.
            (D) Dispute Notice. In the event of a Dispute, you or Xenontech Technologies must first send to the other
            party a
            notice of the Dispute that shall include a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact
            information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested (the
            “Dispute Notice”). The Dispute Notice to Xenontech Technologies must be addressed to: Xenontech
            Technologies, B-2,
            Street no.4, Amrit Vihar, Burari,Delhi-84 (the “Xenontech Technologies Notice Address”). The Dispute Notice
            to you
            will be sent by certified mail to the most recent address we have on file or otherwise in our records for
            you. If Xenontech Technologies and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within sixty (60)
            days
            after the Dispute Notice is received, you or Xenontech Technologies may commence an arbitration proceeding
            pursuant to this Section. Following submission and receipt of the Dispute Notice, each of us agrees to act
            in good faith to seek to resolve the Dispute before commencing arbitration.
            (E) WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS. YOU AND Xenontech TECHNOLOGIES AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY
            BRING
            DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN
            ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS
            ACTIONS, OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS. NEITHER YOU NOR Xenontech TECHNOLOGIES WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD
            AS A
            CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OF
            PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. NO ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH
            ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.
            (F) Arbitration Procedure. If a party elects to commence arbitration, the arbitration will be administered
            by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the AAA
            (“AAA Rules”) in conjunction with the rules set forth in these Terms, except that AAA may not administer any
            multiple claimant or class arbitration, as the parties agree that the arbitration shall be limited to the
            resolution only of individual claims. The AAA Rules are at adr.org or by calling them. If there is a
            conflict between the AAA Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms
            shall govern. You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to
            federal, state, or local laws, as limited by the Limitation of Liability set forth in Section 19 of this
            Agreement. All Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a
            reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator is bound by these
            Terms. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority
            to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or
            formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is
            void or voidable. The arbitrator shall also have exclusive authority to rule on his or her own jurisdiction,
            including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration agreement or
            to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Notwithstanding this broad delegation of authority to the
            arbitrator, a court may determine the limited question of whether a claim or cause of action is for (i)
            trade secret misappropriation, (ii) patent infringement, (iii) copyright infringement or misuse, or (iv)
            trademark infringement or dilution, which are excluded from the definition of “Disputes” as stated above.
            The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in
            equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court
            of competent jurisdiction. You may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone. Arbitration
            hearings not conducted by telephone shall take place in a location reasonably accessible from your primary
            residence (or principal place of business if you are a small business), or in Maricopa County, Arizona, at
            your option.
            (G) Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding. If either you or Xenontech Technologies decide to arbitrate a
            Dispute,
            we agree to the following procedure:
            i. Write a Demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Dispute and the amount of
            damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at adr.org (“Demand for
            Arbitration: Consumer Arbitration Rules”).
            ii. Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to AAA by mail at American Arbitration Association Case
            Filing Services 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100 Voorhees, NJ 08043.
            iii. Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party at the same address as the Dispute
            Notice, or as otherwise agreed to by the parties.
            (H) Hearing Format. In all hearing formats, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that explains the
            essential findings and conclusions on which an award, if any, is based. During the arbitration, the amount
            of any settlement offer made by Xenontech Technologies or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until
            after
            the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Xenontech Technologies is entitled. The
            discovery or
            exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute may be allowed during the arbitration.
            (I) Arbitration Fees and Payments.
            i. Disputes involving $ 15,000.00 or less. Xenontech Technologies will promptly reimburse your filing fees
            and pay
            the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. If you reject Xenontech Technologies’ last written settlement
            offer
            made before the arbitrator was appointed (“Xenontech Technologies’ last written offer”), your dispute goes
            all the
            way to an arbitrator’s decision (called an “award”), and the arbitrator awards you more than Xenontech
            Technologies’ last written offer, Xenontech Technologies will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $
            1,000.00;
            (ii) pay twice your reasonable attorney’s fees, if any; and (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert
            witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing
            your claim in arbitration. The arbitrator will determine the amount of fees, costs, and expenses unless you
            and Xenontech Technologies agree on them.
            ii. Disputes involving more than $ 15,000.00. The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s
            and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
            iii. Disputes involving any amount. In any arbitration you commence, Xenontech Technologies will seek its
            AAA or
            arbitrator’s fees and expenses, or your filing fees it reimbursed, only if the arbitrator finds the
            arbitration frivolous or brought for an improper purpose. In any arbitration Xenontech Technologies
            commences, Xenontech
            Technologies will pay all filing, AAA, and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. Xenontech Technologies will not
            seek
            its attorney’s fees or expenses from you in any arbitration. Fees and expenses are not included in
            determining the amount in dispute.
            (J) Claims or Disputes Must be Filed Within One Year. To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute
            to which this Section applies must be filed within one year in small claims or in arbitration. The one-year
            period begins when the claim or Notice of Dispute first could be filed. If not filed within one year, the
            claim or dispute will be permanently barred.
            (K) 30-Day Opt-out Period. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE ARBITRATION PROVISION IN THIS DISPUTES
            SECTION, YOU MUST NOTIFY Xenontech TECHNOLOGIES BY E-MAILING info@xenontech.com WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE
            THAT
            YOU
            ACCEPT THESE TERMS (UNLESS A LONGER PERIOD IS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW). In the
            e-mail, you must provide your (a) first name, (b) last name (c) address, (d) phone number, and (e) account
            number(s) and state the following: “I wish to opt out of the arbitration provision contained in Xenontech
            Technologies’ Universal Terms of Service Agreement.” By providing your information in the method above, you
            are opting out of the agreement to arbitrate contained in Xenontech Technologies’ Universal Terms of
            Service. Your
            opt-out request will only be valid if made within thirty (30) days of first accepting the Universal Terms of
            Service. In the event that you opt-out consistent with the procedure set forth above, all other terms shall
            contained herein shall continue to apply, including those related to the applicable governing law and the
            court(s) in which legal disputes may be brought.
            (L) Amendments to this Section. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and
            Xenontech
            Technologies agree that if Xenontech Technologies makes any future amendments to the dispute resolution
            procedure
            and class action waiver provisions (other than a change to Xenontech Technologies’ address) in these Terms,
            Xenontech
            Technologies will notify you and you will have thirty (30) days from the date of notice to affirmatively
            opt-out of any such amendments. If you affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you are agreeing that
            you will arbitrate any Dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Section as stated in these
            current Terms, without any of the proposed amendments governing. If you do not affirmatively opt-out of any
            future amendments, you will be deemed to have consented to any such future amendments.
            (M) Severability. If any provision in this Section is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be
            severed with the remainder of these Terms remaining in full force and effect. The foregoing shall not apply
            to the prohibition against class or representative actions; if the prohibition against class or
            representative actions is found to be unenforceable, this entire Section shall be null and void. The terms
            of this Section shall otherwise survive any termination of these Terms.
            (N) Exclusive Venue for Other Controversies. Xenontech Technologies and you agree that any controversy
            excluded
            from the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions in this Section (other than an
            individual action filed in small claims court) shall be filed only in the Superior Court of Maricopa County,
            Arizona, or the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, and each party hereby irrevocably
            and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for any such
            controversy. You also agree to waive the right to trial by jury in any such action or proceeding.

            Laws, you shall not access this Site or the Services found at this Site. The obligations under this section

          </center><br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The titles and headings of this Agreement are for convenience and ease of
            reference only and shall not be utilized in any way to construe or interpret the agreement of the parties as
            otherwise set forth herein. Each covenant and agreement in this Agreement shall be construed for all
            purposes to be a separate and independent covenant or agreement. If a court of competent jurisdiction holds
            any provision (or portion of a provision) of this Agreement to be illegal, invalid, or otherwise
            unenforceable, the remaining provisions (or portions of provisions) of this Agreement shall not be affected
            thereby and shall be found to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

          <p style="text-align: justify;">This Agreement, along with all policies and the applicable product agreements
            identified above and incorporated herein by reference (collectively, the “Agreement”),
            is executed in the English language. To the extent any translation is provided to you, it is provided for
            convenience purposes only, and in the event of any conflict between the English and translated version,
            where permitted by law, the English version will control and prevail. Where the translated version is
            required to be provided to you and is to be considered binding by law (i) both language versions shall have
            equal validity, (ii) each party acknowledges that it has reviewed both language versions and that they are
            substantially the same in all material respects, and (iii) in the event of any discrepancy between these two
            versions, the translated version may prevail, provided that the intent of the Parties has been fully taken
            into consideration.
